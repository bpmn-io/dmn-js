Hello!

My name is Ülari Laurson and I am a Computer Science master student in University of Tartu. My thesis topic is to 
verify DMN tables and their rules. I doing this verifier using DMN.io. My code finds missing rules and overlapping 
rules in DMN.io.  My question is, are you interested what I am implementing right now or not? 

Best
